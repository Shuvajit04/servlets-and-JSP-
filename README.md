# Servlets and JSP Project

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Java Servlets** and **JavaServer Pages (JSP)** for building dynamic web applications.  
It focuses on how client requests are handled by servlets, how JSP is used for the presentation layer, and how both integrate with a backend database to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the **servlet lifecycle** and request–response flow.
- Implement **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture using Servlets and JSP.
- Learn how to manage **form data**, **sessions**, and **cookies**.
- Integrate with a **MySQL database** for data persistence.
- Demonstrate user authentication and CRUD operations.

## 🧱 Technologies Used
| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Frontend | HTML, CSS, JSP |
| Backend | Java Servlets, JDBC |
| Server | Apache Tomcat |
| Database | MySQL |
| IDE | Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code |
| Build Tool | Maven (optional) |

# Java Application Using Spring and Hibernate

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of **Spring Framework** and **Hibernate ORM** to build a robust Java application.  
It covers key enterprise-level concepts including **Dependency Injection (DI)**, **CRUD Operations**, and **Transaction Management**.  
The goal is to show how Spring manages application components and Hibernate handles database operations efficiently.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand **Spring Core** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** principles.
- Implement **CRUD operations** using Hibernate ORM.
- Manage **transactions** using Spring's declarative transaction management.
- Integrate **Spring and Hibernate** in a single modular Java application.
- Learn best practices for **loose coupling** and **object persistence**.

## 🧱 Technologies Used
| Component | Technology |
|------------|-------------|
| Programming Language | Java |
| Frameworks | Spring, Hibernate |
| Database | MySQL (or any relational DB) |
| ORM | Hibernate 5+ |
| Server | Apache Tomcat (optional) |
| Build Tool | Maven |
| IDE | IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code |
